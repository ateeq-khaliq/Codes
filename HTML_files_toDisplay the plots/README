# Interactive Plot Gallery Generator

This project generates an interactive HTML gallery for visualizing multiple plots, specifically designed for MetaPrograms (NMF) Exploratory Analysis.

## Files

1. `generate_html.py`: The main script that processes plots and generates the HTML file.
2. `plot_config.py`: Configuration file containing plot file paths and other settings.
3. `plot_descriptions.py`: File containing descriptions and headings for each plot.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the three Python files to a directory of your choice.

2. Install the required Python libraries:

3. If working with PDF files, install Poppler:
- macOS: `brew install poppler`
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils`
- Windows: Download from the Poppler website and add the bin folder to your system PATH.

## Configuration

1. In `plot_config.py`:
- Update `plot_files` list with the paths to your plot files.
- Modify `output_dir` and `output_html` to set the output locations.
- Adjust `title`, `lab_name`, and `proprietary_text` as needed.

2. In `plot_descriptions.py`:
- Update the `plot_details` dictionary with appropriate headings and descriptions for each plot.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts:

cd /path/to/your/script/directory

3. Run the main script: python generate_html.py

4. The script will generate an HTML file at the location specified in `plot_config.py`.

5. Open the generated HTML file in a web browser to view your interactive plot gallery.

## Customization

- To change the plots or their order, modify the `plot_files` list in `plot_config.py`.
- To update plot descriptions or headings, edit the `plot_details` dictionary in `plot_descriptions.py`.
- For style or layout changes, modify the HTML template in `generate_html.py`.

## Output

The script generates a self-contained HTML file with all plots embedded. This file can be shared and viewed on any device with a modern web browser, without needing additional files or internet connection.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with PDF conversion, ensure Poppler is correctly installed and accessible in your system PATH.
- For large PDF files, you may need to increase the memory limit for the Python process.

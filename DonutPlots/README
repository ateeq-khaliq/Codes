# Single-cell RNA-seq Data Visualization: Donut Plots

This R script generates donut plot visualizations for comparing cell type distributions across different samples and treatment groups in a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset.

## Description

The script produces three types of donut plots:
1. Individual sample donut plots
2. Individual sample donut plots with percentage labels
3. Treatment group-wise donut plots

All plots are saved as PDF files.

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0.0 or higher recommended)
- Required R packages:
  - ggplot2
  - dplyr
  - RColorBrewer
  - gridExtra
  - grid
  - wesanderson

## Installation

Install the required R packages using the following commands:

```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "RColorBrewer", "gridExtra", "wesanderson"))

Usage

Ensure your data is in the correct format (see Data Format section).
Set your working directory to the location of the script and data.
Run the script in R or RStudio.

Data Format
The script expects a data frame named meta with the following columns:

orig.ident: Sample identifiers
new_celltype: Cell type labels
treatment_group: Treatment group labels

Output
The script generates two PDF files:

Donut_Plots_Samples_by_Treatment.pdf: Individual sample donut plots
Donut_Plots.pdf: Treatment group-wise donut plots

Script Workflow

Load and prepare the data
Define color palettes
Create functions for generating donut plots
Generate individual sample donut plots
Generate treatment group-wise donut plots
Save plots to PDF files

Customization

Color palettes can be modified by changing the colors variable
Plot titles, labels, and themes can be adjusted in the ggplot and theme functions
The layout of plots can be modified in the grid.arrange function calls

Troubleshooting

Ensure all required packages are installed and loaded
Check that your data frame matches the expected format
If encountering memory issues with large datasets, consider increasing R's memory limit or processing subsets of the data

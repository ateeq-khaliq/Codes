myCAF Proportion Analysis Plots
Description
This R script generates a comprehensive visualization of myCAF (myofibroblast-like Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts) proportions across different compositional clusters (CC), comparing treated and untreated conditions. The script produces a multi-panel PDF containing four different visualization styles.
Dependencies
Required R packages:

ggplot2
cowplot
viridis
gridExtra
dplyr

Input Data Requirements
The script expects the following data objects:

myCAF_df: A dataframe containing spot-level myCAF proportions with columns:

CompositionCluster_CC: Cluster assignments (CC01-CC10)
myCAF_prop: myCAF proportion values
treated: Treatment status ("Yes"/"No")


myCAF_proportions: A summarized dataframe of myCAF proportions per cluster

Output

A PDF file named "myCAF_analysis_plots.pdf" (12" × 15") containing four plots:

Overall myCAF proportions bar plot
Side-by-side bar plot comparing treated vs untreated conditions with error bars
Box plot showing distribution with individual points
Violin plot showing distribution with embedded box plots



Plot Details

Overall Bar Plot

Simple visualization of myCAF proportions across clusters
Color: Dark purple (#4B0082)


Treated vs Untreated Bar Plot

Comparison of means with standard error bars
Colors: Pink (#FF69B4) for untreated, Blue (#4169E1) for treated


Box Plot

Shows distribution with individual points
Jittered points for better visualization
Same color scheme as bar plot


Violin Plot

Shows full distribution with embedded box plots
White box plots inside colored violin plots
Same color scheme as other plots



Usage
RCopy# Run the entire script
source("myCAF_analysis_script.R")
Plot Customization
All plots include:

45° angled x-axis labels
Minimal theme with subtle grid lines
Consistent font sizes
Clear titles and labels
Standardized cluster ordering: CC10 → CC07 → CC03 → CC01 → CC06 → CC08 → CC09 → CC05

Notes

Error bars represent standard error of the mean
Outliers are included in the violin plots but hidden in box plots
All plots maintain consistent cluster ordering to reflect spatial trajectory
Treated/untreated conditions are consistently color-coded across all plots

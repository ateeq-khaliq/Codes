🔬 Project Overview
This project, led by Ateeq Khaliq for Heather's Syngenic Mouse Models, focuses on analyzing spatial transcriptomics data from mouse samples using the Visium FLEX platform. The study aims to investigate gene expression patterns in various conditions, including vehicle-treated and inhibitor-treated samples from both male and female mice.
📊 Data Description

Organism: Mouse (Mus musculus) 🐁
Experiment Type: Visium FLEX spatial transcriptomics
Sample Types:

Vehicle-treated female mice
Inhibitor-treated female mice
Vehicle-treated male mice
Inhibitor-treated male mice


Total Samples: 15 (8 vehicle-treated, 7 inhibitor-treated)
Data Format: FASTQ files from Illumina sequencing

🛠️ Requirements

Access to a SLURM-based HPC system
CellRanger (version 7.2.0) installed and accessible as a module
Sufficient storage space for CellRanger output (>500GB recommended)
Input data:

FASTQ files from your Visium FLEX experiment
Mouse reference genome (mm10)
Visium FLEX probe set file for mouse

🚀 Usage

Save the script as cellranger-slurm-script.sh in your project directory.
Make the script executable:
bashCopychmod +x cellranger-slurm-script.sh

Submit the job to SLURM:
bashCopysbatch cellranger-slurm-script.sh


📝 Script Details
The script performs the following steps:

Changes to the project directory
Loads the CellRanger module (version 7.2.0)
Creates a configuration file (cellranger_config.csv) with:

Paths to mouse reference genome and probe set
FASTQ file location
Sample information and probe barcode IDs for all 15 samples


Runs CellRanger multi using the generated configuration file

📦 Output

Main output directory: Chrm_499_OHagan_IUB_FLEX15_run6 (or similar)
SLURM logs: cellranger_multi.out and cellranger_multi.error
Configuration file: cellranger_config.csv

⚙️ Customization

Adjust SLURM directives (--time, --mem, --cpus-per-task) as needed
Modify sample information if your experiment setup differs

🔧 Troubleshooting

Check cellranger_multi.error for job failure details
Verify all paths in the script
Ensure probe barcode IDs match your experimental setup

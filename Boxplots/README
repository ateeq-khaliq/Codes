# Single-cell RNA-seq Data Visualization

This R script generates visualizations for comparing cell type distributions across different treatment groups in a mouse single-cell RNA sequencing dataset.

## Description

The script produces two types of plots:
1. An all-in-one plot comparing all cell types and treatment groups
2. Individual plots for each cell type comparing treatment groups

Both plots include statistical comparisons using the Wilcoxon test and are saved as PDF files.

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0.0 or higher recommended)
- Required R packages:
  - dplyr
  - ggplot2
  - ggsignif
  - tidyr
  - ggpubr

## Installation

Install the required R packages using the following commands:

```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "ggsignif", "tidyr", "ggpubr"))

Certainly! Here's a README file for the R script you've provided:

Usage

Ensure your data is in the correct format (see Data Format section).
Set your working directory to the location of the script and data.
Run the script in R or RStudio.

Data Format
The script expects a data frame named result with the following structure:

A column named samples for sample identifiers
A column named treatment_group for treatment group labels
Additional columns for each cell type, containing percentage values

Output
The script generates two PDF files:

comparison_treatment_groups_all.pdf: All-in-one plot
boxplot_results_Individual.pdf: Individual plots for each cell type

Script Workflow

Correct spelling mistakes in treatment group names
Reshape data from wide to long format
Generate all-in-one plot

Create box plot with custom colors
Add significance bars and p-values for pairwise comparisons


Generate individual plots

Create separate box plots for each cell type
Add significance comparisons and p-values
Apply custom theme and color palette



Customization

Color palettes can be modified by changing the custom_colors and palette variables
Plot titles, labels, and themes can be adjusted in the ggplot and theme functions
Statistical comparison methods and display can be modified in the stat_compare_means function calls

Troubleshooting

Ensure all required packages are installed and loaded
Check that your data frame matches the expected format
If encountering memory issues with large datasets, consider increasing R's memory limit or processing subsets of the data
